A large increase in ridership (>20%) was observed as a result, leading to nationwide interest in a post-mortem report.Using Power BI, I generated all the data visualizations for the FFF report. I also read and manually categorized about 2,000 customer comments for sentiment analysis."

Using Microsoft Azure cloud services, I set up a pipeline to scrape data from EPA and AirNow.gov APIs. The report automatically refreshes with new data each morning."
