## Disclaimer

By nature, it is challenging to build a business intelligence portfolio since most BI work is generated for internal company use. Examples on this page are a small subset of my work that is publicly available. I hope to add more to this portfolio in the near future.

## Utah Transit Authority - Free Fare February Report

::: {layout-ncol=2 layout-valign="center"}

UTA declared "Free Fare February" (FFF) in 2022, granting free access to all public transit modes (bus, light rail, commuter rail, and more). A large increase in ridership (>20%) was observed as a result, leading to nationwide interest in a post-mortem report.<br/><br/>Using Power BI, I generated all the data visualizations for the FFF report. I also read and manually categorized about 2,000 customer comments for sentiment analysis.<br/><br/>

Utah intermittently has some of the worst air quality in the United States due to the bowl-shaped topography of the mountains which surround the [Wasatch Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Front), wildfires, and [inversion effects](https://deq.utah.gov/air-quality/inversions).<br/><br/>In April 2022, I began working on a Power BI report to analyze recent and historical air quality trends in Utah. Using Microsoft Azure cloud services, I set up a pipeline to scrape data from EPA and AirNow.gov APIs. The report automatically refreshes with new data each morning.
